*	instead of just showing the end-user what happened during an error
	(500, 404, etc), start setting errno and use perror/strerror to
	show what the hell was going on on the console.

*	make the log more apache-style, including user ip, user agent, etc

*	start adding debugging levels. 3 should be good.
	 it will make the code messy though. :(

DONE!	make files transfers buffered, don't load the whole file into memory before sending it.
-	fixed this by using sendfile(), but this seems to cause problems with a high number of concurrent requests!

*	port to windows, cygwin, *bsd

*	add keep-alive

*	add Range header, for partial transfers

*	add the ability to fork to the background

*	fix urlencoding of generated links in directory listing
